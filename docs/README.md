# Vue TopoJSON Map

This is a flexible vue component for displaying topojson maps in a vue application.

TopoJson is an efficient way to store and transmit geographic data, and can be used to dislay maps and geographic information in a lightweight way, especially on applications also using D3 for data visualizations.

This particular implementation is focused on displaying geographic maps in a vue-centric way, unlike some similar libraries which wrap but don't extend the d3 geographic tools.
